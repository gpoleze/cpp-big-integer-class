# C++ BigInteger Class
The C++ BigInteger Class implementation is a personal project, which its primary purpose is to create a bigger understanding of the C++ language.

The Big Integer Class was implemented using a linked list container to store the digits from the BigInteger. Moreover, this list was, as well, completely implemented instead of using a standard library. Again, the biggest purpose is to get more familiar with C++.
